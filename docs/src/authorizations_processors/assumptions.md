# Assumptions

- **Funds**: You cannot send funds with the messages.

- **Bridging**: We are assuming that messages can be sent and confirmed bidirectionally between domains. The Authorization contract on the main domain communicates with the processor in a different domain in one direction and the callback confirming the correct or failed execution in the other direction.

- **Instantiation**: All these contracts can be instantiated beforehand and off-chain having predictable addresses. Here is an example instantiation flow using Polytone:
  - Predict `authorization` contract address.
  - Instantiate polytone contracts & set up relayers.
  - Predict `proxy` contract address for the `authorization` contract on each external domain.
  - Predict `proxy` contract address on the main domain for each processor on external domains.
  - Instantiate all `processors`. The sender on external domains will be the predicted `proxy` and on the main domain it will be the Authorization contract iself.
  - Instantiate Authorization contract with all the processors and their predicted proxies for external domains and the processor on the main domain.

- **Relaying**: Relayers will be running once everything is instantiated.

- **Tokenfactory**: The main domain has the token factory module with no token creation fee so that we can create and mint these nonfungible tokens with no additional cost.

- **Domains**: In the current version, actions in each authorization will be limited to a single domain.
