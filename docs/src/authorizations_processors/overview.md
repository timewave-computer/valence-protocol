# Authorizations & Processors

- To have a general purpose set of smart contracts that will provide the users (anyone if the authorization is permissionless or authorization token owners if itâ€™s permissioned) with a single point of entry to interact with the Valence program, which can have libraries and accounts deployed on multiple chains.

- To have all the user authorizations for multiple domains in a single place, making it very easy to control the application.

- To have a single address (`Processor`) that will execute the messages for all the contracts in a domain using execution queues.

- To only tick a single contract (`Processor`) which will go through the queues to route and execute the messages.

- Be able to create, edit or remove different application permissions with ease.
