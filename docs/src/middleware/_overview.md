# Middleware

The Valence Middleware is a set of components that provide a unified interface for the Valence Type system.

At its core, middleware is made up from the following components:
- [**Middleware Broker**](./broker.md), responsible for managing the lifecycle of middleware instances and their associated types
- [**Middleware Type Registry**](./type_registry.md), responsible for unifying a set of foreign types to be used in Valence Programs
- [**Valence Types**](./valence_types.md), defining the native type representations inside Valence Programs

## Design goals

into a single, coherent distributed system.
