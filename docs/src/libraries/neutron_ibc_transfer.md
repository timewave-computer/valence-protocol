# Valence Neutron IBC Transfer library

The **Valence Neutron IBC Transfer** library allows to transfer funds over IBC from an **input account** on **Neutron** to an **output account** on a destination chain. It is typically used as part of a **Valence Program**. In that context, a **Processor** contract will be the main contract interacting with the Forwarder library.

Note: this library should not be used on another CosmWasm chain than **Neutron**, which requires some fees to be paid to relayers for IBC transfers. For other CosmWasm chains, prefer using the **[Generic IBC Transfer library](./generic-ibc-transfer.md)** instead.

## Functions

| Function    | Parameters | Description |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **IbcTransfer** | -          | Transfer funds over IBC from an **input account** on **Neutron** to an **output account** on a destination chain. |

## Configuration

The library is configured on instantiation via the `LibraryConfig` type.

```rust
struct LibraryConfig {
  // Account from which the funds are pulled (on the source chain)
  input_addr: LibraryAccountType,
  // Account to which the funds are sent (on the destination chain)
  output_addr: String,
  // Denom of the token to transfer
  denom: UncheckedDenom,
  // Amount to be transferred, either a fixed amount or the whole available balance.
  amount: IbcTransferAmount,
  // Memo to be passed in the IBC transfer message.
  memo: String,
  // Information about the destination chain.
  remote_chain_info: RemoteChainInfo,
  // Denom map for the Packet-Forwarding Middleware, to perform a multi-hop transfer.
  denom_to_pfm_map: BTreeMap<String, PacketForwardMiddlewareConfig>,
}

// Defines the amount to be transferred, either a fixed amount or the whole available balance.
enum IbcTransferAmount {
  // Transfer the full available balance of the input account.
  FullAmount,
  // Transfer the specified amount of tokens.
  FixedAmount(Uint128),
}

pub struct RemoteChainInfo {
  // Channel of the IBC connection to be used.
  channel_id: String,
  // Port of  the IBC connection to be used.
  port_id: Option<String>,
  // Timeout for the IBC transfer.
  ibc_transfer_timeout: Option<Uint64>,
}

// Configuration for a multi-hop transfer using the Packet Forwarding Middleware
struct PacketForwardMiddlewareConfig {
  // Channel ID from the source chain to the intermediate chain
  local_to_hop_chain_channel_id: String,
  // Channel ID from the intermediate to the destination chain
  hop_to_destination_chain_channel_id: String,
  // Temporary receiver address on the intermediate chain
  hop_chain_receiver_address: String,
}
```
