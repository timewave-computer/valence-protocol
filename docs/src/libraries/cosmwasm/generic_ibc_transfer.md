# Valence Generic IBC Transfer library

The **Valence Generic IBC Transfer** library allows to transfer funds over IBC from an **input account** on a source chain to an **output account** on a destination chain. It is typically used as part of a **Valence Program**. In that context, a **Processor** contract will be the main contract interacting with the Forwarder library.

**Note**: this library should not be used on **Neutron**, which requires some fees to be paid to relayers for IBC transfers. For Neutron, prefer using the dedicated (and optimized) **[Neutron IBC Transfer library](./neutron_ibc_transfer.md)** instead.

## Configuration

The library is configured on instantiation via the `LibraryConfig` type.

```rust
struct LibraryConfig {
  // Account from which the funds are pulled (on the source chain)
  input_addr: LibraryAccountType,
  // Account to which the funds are sent (on the destination chain)
  output_addr: LibraryAccountType,
  // Denom of the token to transfer
  denom: UncheckedDenom,
  // Amount to be transferred, either a fixed amount or the whole available balance.
  amount: IbcTransferAmount,
  // Memo to be passed in the IBC transfer message.
  memo: String,
  // Information about the destination chain.
  remote_chain_info: RemoteChainInfo,
  // Denom map for the Packet-Forwarding Middleware, to perform a multi-hop transfer.
  denom_to_pfm_map: BTreeMap<String, PacketForwardMiddlewareConfig>,
  // Configuration used for IBC Eureka transfers
  eureka_config: Option<EurekaConfig>,
}

// Defines the amount to be transferred, either a fixed amount or the whole available balance.
enum IbcTransferAmount {
  // Transfer the full available balance of the input account.
  FullAmount,
  // Transfer the specified amount of tokens.
  FixedAmount(Uint128),
}

pub struct RemoteChainInfo {
  // Channel of the IBC connection to be used.
  channel_id: String,
  // Port of  the IBC connection to be used.
  port_id: Option<String>,
  // Timeout for the IBC transfer.
  ibc_transfer_timeout: Option<Uint64>,
}

// Configuration for a multi-hop transfer using the Packet Forwarding Middleware
struct PacketForwardMiddlewareConfig {
  // Channel ID from the source chain to the intermediate chain
  local_to_hop_chain_channel_id: String,
  // Channel ID from the intermediate to the destination chain
  hop_to_destination_chain_channel_id: String,
  // Temporary receiver address on the intermediate chain. Typically this is set to an invalid address so the entire transaction will revert if the forwarding fails. If not
  // provided it's set to "pfm"
  hop_chain_receiver_address: Option<String>,
}

// Configuration for IBC Eureka transfers
pub struct EurekaConfig {
    /// The address of the contract on intermediate chain that will receive the callback.
    pub callback_contract: String,
    /// The address of the contract on intermediate chain that will trigger the actions, in this case the Eureka transfer.
    pub action_contract: String,
    /// Recover address on intermediate chain in case the transfer fails
    pub recover_address: String,
    /// Source channel on the intermediate chain (e.g. "08-wasm-1369")
    pub source_channel: String,
    /// Optional memo for the Eureka transfer triggered by the contract. Not used right now but could eventually be used.
    pub memo: Option<String>,
    /// Timeout in seconds to be used for the Eureka transfer. For reference, Skip Go uses 12 hours (43200). If not passed we will use that default value
    pub timeout: Option<u64>,
}
```

### Packet-Forward Middleware

The library supports multi-hop IBC transfers using the Packet Forward Middleware (PFM).
This allows tokens to be transferred through an intermediate chain to reach their final
destination. More information about the PFM functionality can be found in the [official
documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-apps/tree/main/middleware/packet-forward-middleware).

Generic IBC Transfer library can be configured to make use of PFM as follows:

- `output_addr` is set to the final receiver address on the final destination chain
- `remote_chain_info` is configured between the origin and intermediate chain
- `denom_to_pfm_map` is configured to map the origin denom to its respective
  `PacketForwardMiddlewareConfig` which should contain:

  - `local_to_hop_chain_channel_id` - origin to intermediate chain channel id
  - `hop_to_destination_chain_channel_id` - intermediate to destination chain channel id
  - `hop_chain_receiver_address` - address where funds should settle on the intermediate
    chain in case of a failure

> Official packet-forward-middleware recommends to configure intermediate chain settlement
> addresses (`hop_chain_receiver_address`) with an invalid bech32 string such as `"pfm"`.
> More information about this can be found in the [official documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-apps/tree/main/middleware/packet-forward-middleware#full-example---chain-forward-a-b-c-d-with-retry-on-timeout).

Consider an example configuration transferring tokens from Osmosis to Gaia via Juno.
Library config may look like this:

```rust
LibraryConfig {
    input_addr: input_acc,
    output_addr: output_acc,
    denom: UncheckedDenom::Native(target_denom),
    amount: IbcTransferAmount::FixedAmount(transfer_amount),
    memo: "".to_string(),
    remote_chain_info: RemoteChainInfo {
        channel_id: osmosis_to_juno_channel_id,
        ibc_transfer_timeout: Some(500u64.into()),
    },
    denom_to_pfm_map: BTreeMap::from([(
        denom,
        PacketForwardMiddlewareConfig {
            local_to_hop_chain_channel_id: osmosis_to_juno_channel_id,
            hop_to_destination_chain_channel_id: juno_to_gaia_channel_id,
            hop_chain_receiver_address: None, // if not passed, "pfm" is used
        },
    )]),
    eureka_config: None,
}
```

### IBC Eureka

This library supports IBC Eureka transfers using an intermediate chain. This allows tokens to be transferred from the origin chain to EVM chains connected with IBC Eureka using standard IBC transfers together with Skip Go capabilities. For more information on how IBC Eureka works with Skip Go, please refer to this [Eureka overview](https://docs.skip.build/go/eureka/eureka-overview).

Currently, all IBC Eureka transfers are routed through the Cosmos Hub, but the library can be configured to use any other chain as the intermediate chain in the future.
The library can be configured to make use of IBC Eureka as follows:

- `output_addr` is set to the final receiver address on the final EVM chain (0x address)
- `remote_chain_info` is configured between the origin and intermediate chain
- `eureka_config` is configured with the addresses used to trigger the actions on the intermediate chain and the callback contract that will be called when the transfer is completed.
  - `callback_contract` - address of the contract on the intermediate chain that will trigger the callback.
  - `action_contract` - address of the contract on the intermediate chain that will trigger the actions, in this case the Eureka transfer.
  - `recover_address` - address on the intermediate chain that will be used to recover the funds in case the transfer fails.
  - `source_channel` - source channel on the intermediate chain
  - `memo(Optional)` - memo to be passed in the IBC transfer message. Currently not used but could potentially be used in the future.
  - `timeout(Optional)` - timeout in seconds for the Eureka Transfer. If not provided, a default 43200 seconds (12 hours) will be used. Which is the same that Skip Go uses.

Consider an example configuration transferring ATOM tokens from Neutron to Ethereum.
Library config may look like this:

```rust
LibraryConfig {
    input_addr: "neutron1....",
    output_addr: "0x....",
    denom: UncheckedDenom::Native("ibc/C4CFF46FD6DE35CA4CF4CE031E643C8FDC9BA4B99AE598E9B0ED98FE3A2319F9".to_string()),
    amount: IbcTransferAmount::FullAmount,
    memo: "".to_string(),
    remote_chain_info: RemoteChainInfo {
        channel_id: "channel-1", // Neutron to Cosmos Hub channel id
        ibc_transfer_timeout: None, // Default 10 minutes used
    },
    denom_to_pfm_map: BTreeMap::default(),
    eureka_config: {
        callback_contract: "cosmos1lqu9662kd4my6dww4gzp3730vew0gkwe0nl9ztjh0n5da0a8zc4swsvd22".to_string(),
        action_contract: "cosmos1clswlqlfm8gpn7n5wu0ypu0ugaj36urlhj7yz30hn7v7mkcm2tuqy9f8s5".to_string(),
        recover_address: "cosmos1....".to_string(),
        source_channel: "08-wasm-1369".to_string(),
        memo: None,
        timeout: None,
    }
}
```

When configuring the library or executing the **EurekaTransfer** function, the following Skip Go query can be used to get all the required information. Here's an example query to transfer 5 ATOM from Neutron to Ethereum.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://go.skip.build/api/skip/v2/fungible/route" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source_asset_chain_id": "neutron-1",
    "source_asset_denom": "ibc/C4CFF46FD6DE35CA4CF4CE031E643C8FDC9BA4B99AE598E9B0ED98FE3A2319F9",
    "dest_asset_chain_id": "1",
    "dest_asset_denom": "0xbf6Bc6782f7EB580312CC09B976e9329f3e027B3",
    "amount_in": "5000000",
    "allow_unsafe": true,
    "allow_multi_tx": true,
    "go_fast": true,
    "smart_relay": true,
    "smart_swap_options": {
      "split_routes": true,
      "evm_swaps": true
    },
    "experimental_features": [
      "eureka"
    ]
  }'
```

This query will return the following key information among other things:

- `smart_relay_fee_quote` - the `eureka_fee` information to execute the transfer. **Important**: the timeout for the transfer needs to be passed as nanoseconds.
- `source_client` - the `source_channel` used in the `eureka_config` when configuring the library.
- `callback_adapter_contract_address` - the `callback_contract` used in the `eureka_config` when configuring the library.
- `entry_contract_address` - the `action_contract` used in the `eureka_config` when configuring the library.
