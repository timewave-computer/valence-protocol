# Background

Valence is a liquidity management protocol targeted at crypto-native institutions. Specifically, it aims to become a platform for crypto-native institutions to form multilateral liquidity lending and borrowing relationships. Our workflow system provides a base set of primitives that enable cross-chain orchestration, where actions can be triggered by multiple authorized parties.
