# Introduction

The **Valence Protocol** is a framework designed to help you build *trust-minimized applications*, called **Valence programs**, executing across multiple chains.
Valence programs are:

- **Easy to understand** and **quick to deploy**: a program can be set up with a configuration file and no code.
- **Extensible**: if we don't support a DeFi integration out of the box, you can write one yourself in a matter of hours!

> ðŸ‘‰ **Example Use-case**:
> 
> A DAO wants to bridge tokens to another chain and then deposit the tokens into a vault. After a certain date, it wants to allow a governance proposal to trigger unwinding of the position. While the position is active, It may also want to delegate the right to change vault parameters to a specific committee as long as the parameters are within a certain range.
>
> Without Valence Programs, the DAO would have two choices:  
> **Choice 1:** Give the tokens to a **multisig** to execute actions on the DAO's behalf  
> **Choice 2:** Write **custom smart contracts**, and deployed them across multiple chains, to handle the cross-chain token operations.
>
> **Valence programs** offer a third choice: the DAO does not need to trust a multisig, nor does it need to spend resources writing complex cross-chain logic.
> 
> **Leveraging the Valence Protocol allows the DAO to rapidly configure and deploy a solution that meets its needs.**
