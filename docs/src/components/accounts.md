# Accounts

**Valence Programs** usually perform operations on tokens, accross multiple domains, and to ensure that the funds remain safe throughout a program's execution, they rely on a primitive called **Valence Accounts**.

A **Valence Account** is an escrow contract that can hold balances for various supported token-types (e.g., in Cosmos `ics-20` or `cw-20`) and ensures that only a restricted set of operations can be performed on the held tokens.
A **Valence Account** is created (instantiated) on a specific **domain**, and bound to a specific **Valence Program**. **Valence Programs** will typically use multiple accounts, during the program's lifecycle, for different purposes. **Valence Accounts** are generic in nature; how they are used to form a program is entirely up to the program's creator.

Using a simple _token swap program_ as an example: the program receives an amount of **Token A** in an **input account**, and will **swap** these **Token A** for **Token B** using a **DEX** on the **same domain** (e.g. Neutron). After the swap operation, the received amount of **Token B** will be temporarily held in a **transfer account**, before being transfered to a final **output account** on another domain (e.g. Osmosis).

For this, the program will create the following accounts:
- A **Valence Account** is created on the **Neutron domain** to act as the **Input account**.
- A **Valence Account** is created on the **Neutron domain** to act as the **Transfer account**.
- A **Valence Account** is created on the **Osmosis domain** to act as the **Output account**.

  subgraph Neutron
  IA -- Swap Token A --> DEX
  DEX -- Token B --> TA
  end
  subgraph Osmosis
  TA -- 4/Transfer token B --> OA
  end
```
Note: this is a simplified representation.

**Valence Accounts** do not perform any operation by themselves on the held funds, the operations are performed by **[Valence Libraries](./libraries_and_functions.md)**.
