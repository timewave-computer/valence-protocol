> ðŸš§ Valence protocol architecture and developer documentation is evolving rapidly. Portions of the toolchain have stabilized for building cross-chain vaults and extending them with multi-party agreements. Send us a message on [X](https://x.com/valencezone) if you'd like to get started!

# Introduction

**Valence** is a unified development environment that enables *trust-minimized cross-chain DeFi applications*, called **Valence programs**.

Valence programs are:

- **Easy to understand** and **quick to deploy**: a program can be set up with a configuration file and no code.
- **Extensible**: if we don't yet support a DeFi integration out of the box, new integrations can be written in a matter of hours!

> **Example Use Case**:
>
> A DeFi protocol wants to bridge tokens to another chain and deposit them into a vault. After a certain date, it wants to unwind the position. While the position is active, it may also want to delegate the right to change vault parameters to a designated committee so long as the parameters are within a certain range.

Without Valence programs, the protocol would have two choices:  
1. Give the tokens to a **multisig** to execute actions on the protocol's behalf.  
2. Write **custom smart contracts** and deploy them across multiple chains to handle the cross-chain token operations.

**Valence programs** offer a third choice: the protocol does not need to trust a multisig, nor does it need to spend resources writing complex cross-chain logic.

*By using Valence, the protocol can rapidly configure and deploy a secure solution that meets its needs.*
