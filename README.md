# Valence Protocol

Valence is a cross-chain execution environment for developing trust-minimized multi-party programs.
Valence programs use a resource model to structure control flow, compiling to target domains as a collection of application-specific co-processors.

## Status

This project is under heavy development, however portions of the toolchain have stabilized to build programs for cross-chain liquidity deployment and multi-party agreements. Programs may be written in a constrained configuration language or using rust, though developer documentation for the latter is currently quite sparse.

Valence currently supports connections to Cosmos and EVM domains, with SVM coming soon. Programs currently compile to WASM, with planned support for RISC zk circuits.
