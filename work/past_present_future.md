# Valence: Past, Present, and Future of Cross-Chain Applications

In the world of blockchain, time shapes everything. From determining transaction ordering to maintaining consistency across distributed ledgers, temporal relationships create the fabric of distributed computation. The Valence Protocol's journey offers a window into how these temporal dynamics evolve as cross-chain applications transform from elaborate coordination mechanisms to effortless trustless execution.

## Past: The Era of Protocol Diplomacy

In blockchain's early days, each protocol operated as a sovereign entity with its own rules, currency, and governance. When protocols needed to collaborate, they relied on trusted intermediaries—multisigs controlled by committees who could, in theory, abscond with assets at any moment. Time operated differently across these sovereign domains, with no shared concept of "when" events occurred or in what sequence they should execute.

Valence emerged from this fundamental challenge: how could protocols enter into complex financial relationships without introducing counterparty risk? The initial manifestation came through Covenants, a system that allowed protocols to engage in sophisticated liquidity-sharing arrangements while respecting the asynchronous nature of cross-chain time.

Consider the Neutron and MantaDAO collaboration. Both protocols wanted to deepen liquidity for their native tokens across multiple decentralized exchanges. Without Valence, this would require complex off-chain agreements and operational oversight. With Covenants, the protocols simply passed governance proposals, committed their tokens, and the system handled the timing intricacies automatically—enforcing lockup durations, managing price fluctuation tolerances, and creating temporal consistency where none naturally existed.

These early deployments highlighted time's critical role. Protocol collaborations needed precise answers to temporal questions: How long would capital remain committed? When could rebalancing occur? What penalties applied for early withdrawal? The system meticulously tracked these temporal relationships across chains with fundamentally different concepts of time.

Building these cross-chain applications required extraordinary development time—a year crafting machinery, tests, and verification systems. Each deployment demanded careful coordination and custom development work. While protocols like Neutron, Stargaze, and Nolus successfully deployed these mechanisms, the time investment remained substantial.

What became clear wasn't just that protocols needed cross-chain relationships—they needed a dramatically faster way to create them.

## Present: The Platform Age

The machinery developed to coordinate protocol relationships evolved into something more powerful: a platform for rapidly creating trust-minimized applications across blockchain environments. Development time collapsed from months to days, as the infrastructure itself—not just individual applications—became the true innovation.

Valence exists today as a unified development environment for building cross-chain DeFi applications. The system compiles programs to target specific domains based on a resource model, transforming cross-chain development from specialized engineering into configuration work.

Modern Valence applications consist of domains (chain-specific execution environments), accounts (which hold assets or data), and libraries (containing reusable business logic). This architecture abstracts away cross-chain complexity while preserving security guarantees across time and space.

Temporal relationships have become even more central. When a cross-chain vault rebalances funds from Cosmos to Ethereum, the system must navigate vastly different block times and finality guarantees, ensuring operations execute in the correct causal sequence despite the temporal diversity of the underlying chains.

Developers using Valence today can build applications spanning Wasm and EVM environments (with SVM support forthcoming) without managing the intricate timing challenges of cross-chain messaging. The authorization and processor system handles these details automatically, enforcing temporal constraints that would otherwise consume enormous development resources.

This platform approach has enabled applications that previously existed only in theory:

Cross-chain yield vaults now monitor and rebalance between yield opportunities across different blockchain ecosystems in near real-time, responding to market conditions faster than any multisig-based approach could achieve.

Protocol-owned liquidity deployment programs allow protocols like Neutron to programmatically deploy native capital across multiple venues based on governance parameters, with timing constraints respected automatically by the system.

What once required months or years of engineering now takes days or weeks. The developer experience has fundamentally shifted from painstakingly synchronizing time across disparate systems to declaratively defining desired outcomes and letting the platform handle temporal consistency.

Yet even as Valence simplifies cross-chain development today, time has not stood still for the system itself.

## Future: The Distributed Runtime

The next evolution of Valence transforms "cross-chain" from a technical integration challenge into a first-class runtime environment. Rather than deploying programs to individual chains with their own notions of time, the future system encodes programs as sets of zero-knowledge verification keys that trustlessly encode protocol operations.

Time becomes a formal, first-class primitive in this system. Operations across domains maintain provable causal relationships through a unified time model based on Lamport clocks. This allows the system to reason about temporal relationships between events across completely different blockchain architectures, creating a single coherent timeline from many independent chains.

For developers, this means writing applications once and interacting with state anywhere, at any time. A single application might seamlessly combine Solana's speed, Ethereum's liquidity, and Cosmos chains' interoperability without forcing developers to reconcile their different temporal models. Development time for cross-chain applications approaches that of single-chain applications, removing one of the most significant barriers to creating sophisticated distributed systems.

This transformation breaks the traditional technical tradeoffs of blockchain development. Applications are no longer bound to a single chain or even a handful of connected chains—they can dynamically interact with any blockchain state through a unified, trustless API that provides consistent temporal semantics across all domains.

The implications extend beyond traditional blockchain applications. This trustless computational fabric creates natural integration points for the "real world" to connect with crypto through simple API calls. AI agents can programmatically control on-chain assets with fine-grained permissions, operating on a shared timeline with cryptographic guarantees about their behavior. Multiple AI systems can interact in trustless ways, coordinating complex operations with precise temporal sequencing.

The distributed runtime fundamentally alters how we conceptualize time in blockchain applications. Instead of struggling to reconcile different chains' notions of "now," the system provides a unified temporal framework where operations across domains maintain precise causal relationships. When an AI agent initiates a complex cross-chain transaction, formal guarantees determine when each step executes and how they temporally relate to one another.

Looking across Valence's evolution—from coordinating protocol relationships to enabling trustless distributed applications—time has been both the central challenge and the core opportunity. Early systems manually enforced timing constraints. Present systems abstract temporal relationships into configurable mechanisms. The future runtime makes time a formal primitive that can be reasoned about across any blockchain domain.

This progression mirrors the broader evolution of distributed systems, where increasingly sophisticated temporal models enable more powerful applications. As blockchains proliferate and specialize, the ability to compose their capabilities while maintaining precise temporal guarantees will become increasingly valuable. The transition from laborious cross-chain engineering to effortless trustless interaction marks a fundamental shift in how we build applications for a multi-chain world.

In this future, time isn't just something applications must accommodate—it becomes a powerful primitive enabling new classes of trustless, distributed applications that span the entire blockchain ecosystem and beyond.
