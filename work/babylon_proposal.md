Problem:
- Babylon's native token is $BABY, which is issued on Babylon Genesis, a Cosmos-SDK-based CosmWasm chain
- Babylon wants to strategically distribute $BABY to partner Babylon Supercharged Networks (BSNs)
- These networks are separate blockchains
- Thus far Babylon has manually distributed tokens to two networks
  - BOB
    - An OP stack optimistic rollup that settles to Ethreum
  - Corn
    - An Arbitrum Orbit chain that settles to Ethereum
    - Uses LayerZero for bridging
- Both Bob and Corn plan to evolve their security configuration. Inheriting security from Babylon by becoming a BSN is an important part of this strategy.
- 

- BOB used their $BABY grant to distribute an airdrop to their users
- Corn used their $BABY grant to incentivize liquidity pools


Target chains
- BOB
- Corn
- Osmosis
  - Cosmwasm Chain
- Plume
  - 
- Union
  - CosmWasm Chain
  - Proprietary bridge protocol
- Tac
  - EVM-based extension network for the Ton blockchain (associated with Telegram messanger)
- Manta
  - 


# Things this could enable

- Cross-chain Pendle-like network (Pendle is only powerful on Ethereum mainnet)

- Automated rewards distribution
    - Each BSN needs to pay BSN stakers and $BABY stakers
    - Cross-chain redistribution of fees from liquidity pools
    - Some from inflation

- Deposit assets into a vault on Babylon, have that vault automatically rebalance to the best risk-adjusted yield from many different chains


- Vault on Genesis chain managed by Centaura
- Vault accepts baby - yield on corn is very high
- Bridge some baby to corn

- Vault accepts an LST, LSTs are on many chains


- Reward distribution - get in touch with main engineer -- intro early next week
- Distribution of rewards can happen in a vault format. BSN paying rewards to a vault
- Finalizing things with Centura
