# Scripts for easy deployment of programs

This directory contains scripts for easy deployment of programs.

## Generate local interchain config

This script is used to generate a manager config from local interchain chains.

In order to build the manager config we need 3 things:

- The chains information like RPC, coin type, etc. to enable the manager to interact with the chains.
- The contract information to be able to instantiate the contracts on the chains. (for example code ids for cosmos chains)
- General information like registry contract address.

The script will generate a config file that can be used by the manager to work with local interchain chains.

## Build program

This script is used to build the program config using the program builder.

In order to use it, you need to modify `my_program.rs` to include your custom program logic, and run the script.

The script will output the program config in a JSON format in `output_program/program.json`.

## Deploy program

To deploy a program we need `manager_config` and `program_config`.

- `manager_config` is generated by the `generate_local_ic_config` script
- `program_config` is generated by the `build_program` script.

The script will use the program manager to deploy the program on your locally running interchain chains.
