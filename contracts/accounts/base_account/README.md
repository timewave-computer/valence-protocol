# Valence Base Account

The **Valence Base Account** is the main type of account used by Valence programs. It suports an **admin** and a set of **approved libraries** that can execute arbitrary messages on behalf of the account.
A typical use case is for a library, configured as approved library on a given account, to transfer part (or the entirety) of the account's token balance (native or CW20) to a target recipient.
