# Valence Interchain Account

The **Valence Interchain Account** is an account that allows executing messages on other Cosmos domains over IBC by creating and controlling an ICS-27 Interchain Account on a remote domain.
A typical use case for libraries configured to work together with a **Valence Interchain Account** is to execute messages on Cosmos domains that don't have CosmWasm or other smart contract capabilities.
