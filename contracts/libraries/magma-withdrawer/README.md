The library is configured on instantiation via the `LibraryConfig` type.

```rust
pub struct LibraryConfig {
    // Address of the input account 
    pub input_addr: LibraryAccountType,
    // Address of the output account 
    pub output_addr: LibraryAccountType,
    // Address of the vault we are going to withdraw liquidity from 
    pub vault_addr: String,
}
```
