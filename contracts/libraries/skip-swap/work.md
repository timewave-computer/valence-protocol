- [x] instrategist.rs it says "In a real implementation" can you fix this so it's a real implementation
- [x] in authorizations.rs it says "would require sending actual messages through the authorization contract" can you fix this so it actually sends messages through the authorization contract
  - Note: We've implemented the integration with the authorization contract but there's an issue - the QueryMsg variants IsPermitted and IsPermittedForParams don't exist in the valence_authorization_utils::msg module. These would need to be added to the library for full functionality.
- [x] in authorizations.rs it says "to check with the Valence authorization contract in the future" several times can you complete the implementation
  - Note: This has been implemented in all relevant functions - asset pair, venue, and slippage checks now verify with the authorization contract.
- [x] in contract.rs it says "In a production environment, this would be an actual query to the strategist" I want you to complete this implementation, which requires the contract cmaking a state change that indicates the desired route to be queried, and then the strategist needs to have a setting where it can poll for this state change, make the coorosponding simulation call to the skip api and return the result to the contract. once the contract receives the simulated route it should use the authorization contract to verify the returned information against the request, then pass that message to be executed just like the route message. we also need a way for an authorized valence account to invoke the skip-swap contract to request a simulated response. the goal is for valence programs to use this as a way to request either a route or an oracle price that will be posted by the strategist on-chain, then to have some validation checks on the route or price, and then pass that message containing the route or price to another contract.
  - Note: Implemented a complete system for route simulation requests and responses. The contract now allows:
    1. Requesting simulations with `RequestRouteSimulation`
    2. Strategist polling for pending requests with `GetPendingSimulationRequests`
    3. Strategist submitting optimized routes with `SubmitRouteSimulation`
    4. Validation of routes against requests and required parameters
    5. Using simulation results in other operations automatically
